**H**ypertext **A**bstract **S**yntax **T**ree format.

* * *

**HAST** discloses HTML as an abstract syntax tree.  _Abstract_
means not all information is stored in this tree and an exact replica
of the original document cannot be re-created.  _Syntax Tree_ means syntax
**is** present in the tree, thus an exact syntactic document can be
re-created.

The reason for introducing a new “virtual” DOM is primarily:

*   The DOM is very heavy to implement outside of the browser,
    a lean and stripped down virtual DOM can be used everywhere
*   Most virtual DOMs do not focus on ease of use in transformations
*   Other virtual DOMs cannot represent the syntax of HTML in its
    entirety (think comments, document types, and character data)
*   Neither HTML nor virtual DOMs focus on positional information

**HAST** is a subset of [Unist][] and implemented by [rehype][].

This document may not be released. See [releases][] for released
documents. The latest released version is [`2.2.0`][latest].

## AST

### `Root`

**Root** ([**Parent**][parent]) houses all nodes.

```idl
interface Root <: Parent {
  type: "root";
}
```

### `Element`

**Element** ([**Parent**][parent]) represents an HTML Element.  For example,
a `div`.  HAST Elements corresponds to the [HTML Element][html-element]
interface.

One element is special, and comes with another property: `<template>` with
`content`.  The contents of a template element is not exposed through its
`children`, like other elements, but instead on a `content` property which
houses a [`Root`][root] node.

`<noscript>` elements should house their tree in the same way as other elements,
as if scripting was not enabled.

```idl
interface Element <: Parent {
  type: "element";
  tagName: string;
  properties: Properties;
  content: Root?;
}
```

For example, the following HTML:

```html
<a href="http://alpha.com" class="bravo" download></a>
```

Yields:

```json
{
  "type": "element",
  "tagName": "a",
  "properties": {
    "href": "http://alpha.com",
    "id": "bravo",
    "className": ["bravo"],
    "download": true
  },
  "children": []
}
```

#### `Properties`

A dictionary of property names to property values.  Most virtual DOMs
require a disambiguation between `attributes` and `properties`.  HAST
does not and defers this to compilers.

```idl
interface Properties {}
```

##### Property names

Property names are keys on [`properties`][properties] objects and
reflect HTML, SVG, ARIA, XML, XMLNS, or XLink attribute names.
Often, they have the same value as the corresponding attribute
(for example, `id` is a property name reflecting the `id` attribute
name), but there are some notable differences.

> These rules aren’t simple.  Use [`hastscript`][h] (or
> [`property-information`][pi] directly) to help.

The following rules are used to disambiguate the names of attributes and their
corresponding HAST property name.
These rules are based on [how ARIA is reflected in the DOM][aria-dfn], and
differs from how some (older) HTML attributes are reflected in the DOM.

1.  Any name referencing a combinations of multiple words (such as “stroke
    miter limit”) becomes a camel-cased property name capitalising each word
    boundary.
    This includes combinations that are sometimes written as several words.
    For example, `stroke-miterlimit` becomes `strokeMiterLimit`, `autocorrect`
    becomes `autoCorrect`, and `allowfullscreen` becomes `allowFullScreen`.
2.  Any name that can be hyphenated, becomes a camel-cased property name
    capitalising each boundary.
    For example, “read-only” becomes `readOnly`.
3.  Compound words that are not used with spaces or hyphens are treated as a
    normal word and the previous rules apply.
    For example, “placeholder”, “strikethrough”, and “playback” stay the same.
4.  Acronyms in names are treated as a normal word and the previous rules apply.
    For example, `itemid` become `itemId` and `bgcolor` becomes `bgColor`.

###### Exceptions

Some jargon is seen as one word even though it may not be seen as such by
dictionaries.
For example, `nohref` becomes `noHref`, `playsinline` becomes `playsInline`,
and `accept-charset` becomes `acceptCharset`.

The HTML attributes `class` and `for` respectively become `className` and
`htmlFor` in alignment with the DOM.
No other attributes gain different names as properties, other than a change in
casing.

###### Notes

The HAST rules for property names differ from how HTML is reflected in the DOM
for the following attributes:

<details>
<summary>View list of differences</summary>

*   `charoff` becomes `charOff` (not `chOff`)
*   `char` stays `char` (does not become `ch`)
*   `rel` stays `rel` (does not become `relList`)
*   `checked` stays `checked` (does not become `defaultChecked`)
*   `muted` stays `muted` (does not become `defaultMuted`)
*   `value` stays `value` (does not become `defaultValue`)
*   `selected` stays `selected` (does not become `defaultSelected`)
*   `char` stays `char` (does not become `ch`)
*   `allowfullscreen` becomes `allowFullScreen` (not `allowFullscreen`)
*   `hreflang` becomes `hrefLang`, not `hreflang`
*   `autoplay` becomes `autoPlay`, not `autoplay`
*   `autocomplete` becomes `autoComplete` (not `autocomplete`)
*   `autofocus` becomes `autoFocus`, not `autofocus`
*   `enctype` becomes `encType`, not `enctype`
*   `formenctype` becomes `formEncType` (not `formEnctype`)
*   `vspace` becomes `vSpace`, not `vspace`
*   `hspace` becomes `hSpace`, not `hspace`
*   `lowsrc` becomes `lowSrc`, not `lowsrc`

</details>

##### Property values

Property values should reflect the data type determined by their
property name.  For example, the following HTML `<div hidden></div>`
contains a `hidden` (boolean) attribute, which is reflected as a `hidden`
property name set to `true` (boolean) as value in HAST, and
`<input minlength="5">`, which contains a `minlength` (valid
integer) attribute, is reflected as a property `minLength`
set to `5` (number) in HAST.

> In JSON, the value `null` must be treated as if the property was not included.
> In JavaScript, both `null` and `undefined` must be similarly ignored.

The DOM is strict in reflecting those properties, and HAST is not,
where the DOM treats `<div hidden=no></div>` as having a `true`
(boolean) value for the `hidden` attribute, and `<img width="yes">`
as having a `0` (number) value for the `width` attribute, these should
be reflected as `'no'` and `'yes'`, respectively, in HAST.

> The reason for this is to allow plug-ins and utilities to inspect
> these non-standard values.

The DOM also specifies comma- and space-separated lists attribute
values.  In HAST, these should be treated as ordered lists.
For example, `<div class="alpha bravo"></div>` is represented as
`['alpha', 'bravo']`.

> There’s no special format for `style`.

### `Doctype`

**Doctype** ([**Node**][node]) defines the type of the document.

```idl
interface Doctype <: Node {
  type: "doctype";
  name: string;
  public: string?;
  system: string?;
}
```

For example, the following HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Yields:

```json
{
  "type": "doctype",
  "name": "html",
  "public": null,
  "system": null
}
```

### `Comment`

**Comment** ([**Text**][text]) represents embedded information.

```idl
interface Comment <: Text {
  type: "comment";
}
```

For example, the following HTML:

```html
<!--Charlie-->
```

Yields:

```json
{
  "type": "comment",
  "value": "Charlie"
}
```

### `Text`

**TextNode** ([**Text**][text]) represents everything that is text.
Note that its `type` property is `text`, but it is different
from the abstract **Unist** interface **Text**.

```idl
interface TextNode <: Text {
  type: "text";
}
```

For example, the following HTML:

```html
<span>Foxtrot</span>
```

Yields:

```json
{
  "type": "element",
  "tagName": "span",
  "properties": {},
  "children": [{
    "type": "text",
    "value": "Foxtrot"
  }]
}
```
